# 3D Immersive Audio
This project is built with Unity and run in Oculus Rift. It provides 3D audio very close to real world experience.

## Motivation
The project aims to help visually impaired people access the visual world by listening. It is planned in 2 parts technologically: real world recognization and 3D audio output. For now, it is a prototype which only provides the second part, 3D audio. 

## Background
I got the inspiration on this project in a hackathon last year. After the hackathon, I plan to go on doing it and, hopefully, make it a product that can help people.
